Project: Tweeter (twitter clone:part 1:application)

  This projects is more designed for the basic concepts 
  of twitter rather than an exact clone. In part: 1 we 
  will build out the beginings of our application.  Throught
  the other parts we will cover the more advanced association
  and javascript.  Thru the weeks we will continue to build on
  this application. Tweeter is going to be pushed live to heroku.
